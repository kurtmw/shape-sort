## Introduction
***

**Explain what the software project about and what are its goals**

* The goal of this software project is to create an application that displays shapes varying in size that is sorted based on their surface area when a button is pressed. An additional button is also present that when pressed, new shapes will be loaded. 

**Explain the challenges associated to the software project**

* The challenges that are associated with this software project are mainly how to properly use out initial understanding of design principle to implement OO systems.   

**Explain the concepts (e.g., OOD, OOD principles, design patterns) you will use to carry out the software project**

**Explain how you are going to structure you report accordingly**
